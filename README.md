# Visualizing Penn SP2 Course Descriptions

In this project, I scrape data from a website and generate word clouds. The generated word clouds show the most common words used in course descriptions for programs housed within the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice's programs (i.e., Social Work, Social Policy, and Nonprofit Leadership). Data were originally scraped in May 2021.

The data were scraped from the University of Pennsylvania's 2020-21 [University Course Catalog](https://catalog.upenn.edu/courses/). Links to program courses can be found in the second column of  [this](https://github.com/ama721/sp2-courses/blob/main/data/Penn-SP2-courses.xlsx) Excel Workbook.
