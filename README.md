This repository shows how to scrape data from a website and generate word clouds. The word clouds generated as a part of this project show the most common words used in course descriptions for programs housed within the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice's programs (i.e., Social Work, Social Policy, and Nonprofit Leadership). Data were originally scraped in May 2021.

The data are scraped from the University of Pennsylvania's 2020-21 [University Course Catalog](https://catalog.upenn.edu/courses/). The links to each program's courses can be found [University Course Catalog](https://github.com/ama721/sp2-courses/blob/main/data/Penn-SP2-courses.xlsx).
